# nodejs-basics-project

## About

This is the server part of the app, which allows users to store a list of books to read and receive recommendations on
what to read next. Developed as a laboratory work for the "Node JS basics" course.

## Stack

Technologies used:

- **JavaScript** – was chosen by us as the compiler because, unlike Typescript, our team has little experience with it
- **Express** – this framework was chosen because of its ease of use by beginners. It can reduce the coding time by half
  and still help us build efficient web applications
- **MongoDB** – because of its convenience, ease of use and good compatibility with JS
